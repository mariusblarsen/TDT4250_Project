# TDT4250 GanttProject

This project contains an xtext DSL that aims to be an intuitive textual way of generating Gantt chart by limiting scope, providing namespace, validation-warnings and appropriate suggestions. The chart is generated by writing tasks and milestone with durations and dependencies, which result in an XMI-file that can be imported into GanttProject.

## Installation

### Dependency

GanttProject 2.8.11 (free), [Installation page](https://www.ganttproject.biz/download/free) *used to view the resulting file*

### Cloning

* Clone repo
* Setup an Eclipse workspace
* Import cloned project into workspace
  * Existing Projects into Workspace wizard
  * Select root directory: */TDT4250_Project
  * Select all projects
  * *Finish*

### Run IDE

* Create new run configuration
  * (Optional) Rename configuration, e.g "Gpx"
  * **Execution environment: ** JavaSE-11
  * In tab "Plug-ins", select "Plug-ins selected below only" and uncheck:
    * tdt4250.ganttproject.xtext.tests (1.0.0.qualifier)
    * tdt4250.ganttproject.xtext.ui.tests (1.0.0.qualifier)
    * tdt4250.ganttproject.xtext.ui.examples (1.0.0.qualifier)
  * Leave rest as default and click "Run"
* With "Gpx" running in a new eclipse
* In the new Eclipse runtime, "File" -> "Import..."
* Choose the "General/Existing Projects into Workspace" wizard
* Click "Next"
* **Select root directory**: Navigate to and select *\\{workspace name\} \tdt4250.ganttproject.xtext.examples
* *"Select all"* and then *"Finish"*
* You are now ready to test the DSL.

### Operating the UI

* Right-click sample.gpx
* *Open with gpx editor*
* Make changes as wanted
* The output XMI file *project.gan* can be found in src-gen found in the workspace
* Open *\{projectName\}.gan* in GanttProject to see the resulting file, or open it as text to view the raw file.
  * Unfortunatly, changes can't be seen in realtime as GanttProject does not refresh when new changes are made to the source-file.
